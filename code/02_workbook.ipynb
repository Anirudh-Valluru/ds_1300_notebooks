    "Another common issue with dealing with messy data is case sensitivity. Since python sees 'A' and 'a' as two different characters, it is important to be aware of case sensitivity. The easiest way to do this is to send all the characters in a particular column to a single case pattern. Fortunately, pandas has a family of functions to do that for us. [lower](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.str.lower.html?highlight=lower#pandas.Series.str.lower) is a good example."
