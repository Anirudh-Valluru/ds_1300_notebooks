    "The second metric we can use is [Cosine Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity), however there is a catch here. Cosine similarity requires a vector for each word so we make a choice here to use term frequency. You could choose something else, inverse document frequency or tf-idf would both be good choices. Cosine similarity with a term frequency vector gives us something very similar to the Jaccard Index but accounts for word repetition. This makes it better for tracking word importance between two texts.\n",
